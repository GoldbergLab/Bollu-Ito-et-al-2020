# tongueSegmentationServer
A client/server application for applying neural networks to automatically segment sets of videos of mouse tongues, using networks trained with training data sets from [manualObjectTracker](../manualObjectTracker). It provides a queueing system to allow multiple users to schedule segmentation jobs on the server, and a HTTP interface for managing and monitoring the server and the progress of segmentation jobs.
