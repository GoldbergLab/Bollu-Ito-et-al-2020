# tongueSegmentationServer
A client/server application for applying neural networks to automatically segment sets of videos of mouse tongues, using networks trained with training data sets from [manualObjectTracker](../manualObjectTracker). It provides a queueing system to allow multiple users to schedule segmentation jobs on the server, and a HTTP interface for managing and monitoring the server and the progress of segmentation jobs. The output of this software is binary tongue mask videos stored as an array in .mat files. This output can be used in [tongueTipTrackerApp](../tongueTipTrackerApp) to calculate various measures of tongue kinematics and geometry.
